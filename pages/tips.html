        <h3> Drink Water - Do Not Buy Drinks </h3>
       <p> Most of the packaged drinks are overpriced and or they
         contain a lot of sugar. All that body needs is water. If you want
         other inexpensive, healthy drinks order some tea,
         fruit punch, or smoothie.</p>
         <h3> Buy Food That You Can Use Multiple Times  </h3>
         <p> Versatille ingredients save your hunger and money. For example without
           tomatos you cannot make Tomato Soup or grilled vegan cheese or pasta
           with Italian tomato sauce or a colorful beautiful salad. Think about
           how many dishes you can prepare with just one ingredient.</p>
           <h3> Stop Thinking Daily - Make a Weekly Plan </h3>
           <p> Each week, mix things up and buy different varieties of food. If
             you eat a salad today think about rice tomorrow, and a coup the day after.
             Before you go grocery shopping, If often: pick up small amounts of food
             to produce enough for the day. If you canâ€™t shop as often, think ahead
             and buy what you might need.<p/>
             <h3> Foods That Grow At The Appropriate Season</h3>
             <p>  Fruits and vegetables are generally cheaper and tastier if they
               are growing in the season they are supposed do. For example, because
                of the abundance of mandarins, oranges and pomegranates in the
                fall, these fruits tend to be less pricey compared to the summer.
                  We recommend zucchini for the summer, brussels sprouts for
                  Thanksgiving and patates in the rough winter times. Seasons for
                  fruits and vegetables vary depending on where you live, so think
                  carefully about where you are and the local food growing in that area. </p>
                  <h3>Be Careful Of Uncooked Food</h3>
                  <p>Undercooked ground beef is one of the main causes of E. coli which can
                    cause symptoms including diarrhea, vomiting and stomach cramps. Undercooked
                    raw poultry or red meat increases the risk for becoming infected with
                     salmonella, trichinosis or toxoplasmosis which could cause abdominal cramps,
                      fever and diarrhea. Undercooked meat, poultry or seafood is also a factor
                      of contributing to listeria which causes fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and nausea.</p>
                      <h3> Replace Desserts With Fruit</h3>
                      <p>Fruit is a great way to satisfy the sweet tooth without having to eat desserts
                        with thousand of calories. Fruits also offer health benefits like fiber and
                        antioxidants which slows your digestion and thereby prevents a spike in blood sugar.
                        Furthermore, potassium, a naturally occurring fruit nutrient, may help you maintain a
                        healthy blood pressure.</p>
